Tic-Tac-Toe game via the terminal

This is a quick Tic Tac Toe game that is played in the terminal

There is some features I can improve and some small bug to smooth out, but the game does work at the moment. If time permit, I wanted to make the code more readable.

To get the game to run, follow the commands below.

Download the .jar file > Open a terminal > type in the following w/out quotes > "java -jar TicTacToe.jar"
